You are hard coding something you should not

_**Assistant**_

The syntax error in the `distill` function is due to duplicated and misplaced code lines, and the path is hardcoded to "~/models" which should be changed to "~/ai/models" based on the interaction history to avoid hardcoding the wrong directory.

Nope, thag format command is hard coding an assumtion in that the path will always have this in it, and if that is the case then this emtire resolving to the home dir is pointless
